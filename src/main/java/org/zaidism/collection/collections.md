# Internal Working of HashMap

## HashMapExample.java

The average case complexity of insertions, updates, and deletions in a HashMap is O(1). However, in the worst-case scenario, due to collisions leading to long linked lists, the complexity degrades to O(n).

### How the put() Method Works in HashMap

- When you create a HashMap, initially, 16 buckets are formed (indexed from 0 to 15) in the hash table. Once the threshold index value, which is more than 12 in a HashMap, is reached, the bucket size increases. The resizing of the map usually doubles its size from 16 to 32 during debugging.
- Each index in the bucket acts as a linked list/node with the following structure: `[Hashcode|Key|Value|Next]`.
- When the `put()` method of the HashMap is called, the hash function is invoked on the key object to generate the hash code. Based on this hash code, the index for the first entry is calculated using the formula: `hashCode & (n-1)`.
- For example, if the index is calculated as 4, a node is created at this index in the bucket with the value `[12342|Jahid|1|null]`.
- If a second entry is added to the map with the key "Amina", and the hash function calculates the same hash code for the key, resulting in the index being 4 again, this situation is called a hash collision.
- In a hash collision scenario, the `equals` function is applied to both keys to check if they are not equal. If they are not equal, the new entry is added to the existing entry as a linked node: `[12342|Jahid|1|1213x] -> [12342|Amina|2|null]` at index 4 of the bucket.
- If the keys are equal, the existing entry in the map is replaced by the new entry.
- If multiple linked lists are formed within the same index, JVM traverses through the linked list, which is not O(1). To address this issue, HashMap in Java 8 replaces the linked list with a balanced tree (red-black tree) to improve performance when the number of elements in the bucket reaches a certain threshold.
- If null keys are provided in the HashMap, the corresponding entry in the form of a node is always stored at the 0th index in the bucket of the hash table. HashMaps allow only one null key.
- While keys can have a null value, values in a HashMap can also be null.
- When the same key is put into the HashMap again, the existing entry is replaced with the latest one.

### How `get` Method Works in HashMap

- When you use `hashMap.get("Amina")`, the hash function calculates the hashcode for the key "Amina."
- Using the hashcode, an index is determined within the HashMap's internal array of buckets. This index is calculated as `index = hashCode & (n-1)`.
- In the bucket at the calculated index, the HashMap checks if there are one or more entries (nodes) with matching hashcodes.
- If a matching hashcode is found, the `equals` method is used to check which node's key matches the provided key ("Amina").
- If a matching key is found within a node, the `get` method returns the corresponding value associated with that key.

## Fail-Fast vs Fail-Safe Iterators

### Fail-Safe

- Fail-safe iterators operate on a copy of the collection instead of the original collection.
- Changes made to the original collection during iteration do not affect the iterator.
- Fail-safe iterators do not throw `ConcurrentModificationException`.
- Instead of relying on mod counts, fail-safe iterators often use mechanisms such as snapshotting (creating a copy of the collection when iteration begins) or maintaining a separate data structure for tracking modifications, ensuring that the iterator can continue iterating over the original collection without interference from concurrent modifications.

### Fail-Fast

- Fail-fast iterators operate directly on the original collection.
- If the collection is modified structurally while iterating (adding, removing), `ConcurrentModificationException` is thrown.
- During iteration, the iterator checks this modification count. If it detects that the count has changed since the iteration began, it indicates that the collection has been modified concurrently, and it throws a `ConcurrentModificationException`.

## HashTable vs ConcurrentHashMap

In Java, both `ConcurrentHashMap` and `Hashtable` are part of the Java Collections Framework and implement the `Map` interface. However, they differ significantly in terms of performance, thread safety, and usage. Here's a detailed comparison between them:

### 1. **Thread Safety**

- **ConcurrentHashMap**:
   - **Thread-safe** for concurrent operations.
   - Unlike `Hashtable`, it allows multiple threads to read and write to the map simultaneously, but with a mechanism that ensures thread safety.
   - **Concurrency Level**: It divides the map into segments (buckets) and allows multiple threads to access different segments simultaneously, improving performance in multi-threaded environments.
   - Operations like `get()`, `put()`, and `remove()` are thread-safe, but not all operations are synchronized at the same level. This makes `ConcurrentHashMap` more scalable than `Hashtable`.

- **Hashtable**:
   - **Thread-safe**, but all its methods are synchronized on the entire map, meaning only one thread can access a method at a time.
   - This can cause performance bottlenecks in highly concurrent environments as the entire map is locked during each operation.
   - Synchronization occurs at the method level, meaning that when one thread is modifying the map, all other threads are blocked.

### 2. **Performance**

- **ConcurrentHashMap**:
   - Generally performs better in multi-threaded scenarios because it allows for concurrent reads and writes (due to its segmented locking mechanism).
   - It uses **lock-striping** (dividing the map into smaller parts) to ensure that multiple threads can update different parts of the map without interfering with each other.

- **Hashtable**:
   - Performance can degrade significantly in multi-threaded environments due to its **synchronized method** approach, where only one thread can access the map at a time.

### 3. **Null Keys and Values**

- **ConcurrentHashMap**:
   - **Does not allow null keys or values**. This is because allowing `null` could lead to ambiguities when a key or value is missing or an operation returns `null`.
   - it throws a `NullPointerException` if you try to insert a `null` key or value.

- **Hashtable**:
   - **Does not allow null keys or values** either. If you try to insert a `null` key or value, it throws a `NullPointerException`.

### 4. **Iteration**

- **ConcurrentHashMap**:
   - Iteration over a `ConcurrentHashMap` is **thread-safe**. The collection can be modified by other threads while you are iterating, without causing `ConcurrentModificationException`.
   - However, the iteration may not reflect all changes, as it provides a **weakly consistent** view of the map.

- **Hashtable**:
   - Iteration is not thread-safe. If the map is modified by another thread while you're iterating, it may cause inconsistent results or throw a `ConcurrentModificationException`.

### 5. **Use Cases**

- **ConcurrentHashMap**:
   - Ideal for situations where you need to perform high-concurrency read and write operations with minimal blocking.
   - Commonly used in multi-threaded applications where high performance and scalability are important.

- **Hashtable**:
   - Used in legacy applications where thread-safety and synchronization are required but concurrency and performance are not major concerns.
   - It is now largely considered outdated, and developers typically prefer `ConcurrentHashMap` or other concurrent collections.

### 6. **API Differences**

- **ConcurrentHashMap**:
   - Offers additional methods for concurrency, such as:
      - `putIfAbsent()`
      - `remove()`
      - `replace()`
      - `computeIfAbsent()`
      - `computeIfPresent()`
   - These methods help manage concurrent modifications more effectively.

- **Hashtable**:
   - Has basic `put()`, `get()`, and `remove()` methods, but lacks the more advanced concurrency features that `ConcurrentHashMap` provides.

### 7. **Size and Resizing**

- **ConcurrentHashMap**:
   - It allows fine-grained control over resizing and automatically expands as needed without locking the entire map.

- **Hashtable**:
   - Resizing involves locking the entire map, which can impact performance, especially with larger data sets.

### 8. **Legacy Status**

- **ConcurrentHashMap**:
   - Part of the **java.util.concurrent** package introduced in Java 5, designed to improve multi-threaded collection handling.

- **Hashtable**:
   - Considered **legacy** and is part of the original Java 1.0. While it is still supported, it is no longer recommended for new projects.

## Why Set Doesn't Allow Duplicate Values?

- In Java, for example, the HashSet implementation of the Set interface uses a HashMap internally to store its elements. When you add an element to a HashSet, it is added as a key in the HashMap, with a dummy value. The uniqueness of keys in a HashMap is enforced by the hashing and equality comparison mechanisms.
- A Set can contain duplicate elements for custom objects if `hashCode` and `equals` methods are not overridden as per their contract.

## Can I Add an Element to a Final ArrayList?

- Yes, but we can't re-assign it as shown below; it will give a compilation error:

  ```java
  final List<Integer> nums = new ArrayList<>();
  nums = new ArrayList<>(); // Compilation error
  ```

- To achieve immutability in an ArrayList, we can use `Collections.unmodifiableList` method:

  ```java
  // Creating a regular ArrayList
  List<String> mutableList = new ArrayList<>();
  mutableList.add("apple");
  mutableList.add("banana");
  mutableList.add("orange");

  // Creating an immutable view of the ArrayList
  List<String> immutableList = Collections.unmodifiableList(mutableList);
  ```

- `List.of` method also creates an unmodifiable List.

## ArrayList vs LinkedList

- `ArrayList` is suitable for storing and accessing data as it works on an indexed-based search like an array, so these operations are faster.
- `LinkedList` is better suited for manipulating data.

---

## HashMap vs ConcurrentHashMap

- **HashMap**: Not thread-safe, fail-fast, allows storing null keys and values, faster than ConcurrentHashMap.
- **ConcurrentHashMap**: Thread-safe, fail-safe, doesn't allow storing null keys and values, slower than HashMap.

---

## Why Not Use `Collections.synchronizedMap` Instead of `ConcurrentHashMap`?

- If we use `Collections.synchronizedMap(map)`, it will act as a synchronized Hashtable where the locking mechanism is different.

## TreeMap vs HashMap

The choice between `TreeMap` and `HashMap` in Java depends on the specific requirements and characteristics of your application. Here are some considerations:

1. **Ordering**:
    - **TreeMap**: Elements are stored in sorted order based on their keys. If you need the elements to be sorted according to the natural order of the keys or a custom comparator, `TreeMap` is the appropriate choice.
    - **HashMap**: Elements are not ordered. If the order of elements is not important or if you need faster insertion, deletion, and retrieval of elements without considering their order, `HashMap` is more suitable.

2. **Performance**:
    - **TreeMap**: Insertion, deletion, and retrieval operations have a time complexity of O(log n) due to the underlying Red-Black Tree structure used for maintaining sorted order. This makes `TreeMap` suitable for scenarios where the number of elements is relatively small or where the need for sorted order outweighs performance concerns.
    - **HashMap**: In general, insertion, deletion, and retrieval operations have an average time complexity of O(1) (constant time). `HashMap` provides better performance for large datasets or scenarios where order is not a concern.

3. **Memory Overhead**:
    - **TreeMap**: Requires additional memory overhead to store the Red-Black Tree structure for maintaining sorted order.
    - **HashMap**: Generally has lower memory overhead compared to `TreeMap` because it doesn't need to maintain any specific order.

4. **Key Immutability**:
    - **TreeMap**: Requires keys to be immutable or at least consistent during the time they are used as keys in the map. This is because the sorting order relies on the keys.
    - **HashMap**: More flexible with key mutability because it doesn't rely on sorting keys.

5. **Custom Sorting**:
    - **TreeMap**: Allows you to specify a custom comparator to define the sorting order of keys.
    - **HashMap**: Doesn't offer built-in support for custom sorting. If you need custom sorting, you would need to sort the keys externally and then perform operations on the map.

In summary:
- Use `TreeMap` when you need elements sorted according to their keys, and the additional overhead and slightly slower performance are acceptable.
- Use `HashMap` when ordering is not important, and you prioritize faster insertion, deletion, and retrieval operations, especially for large datasets.
