Why String is immutable

Key points:
    • String pool is possible only because String is immutable in Java. This way Java Runtime saves a lot of heap space because different String variables can refer to the
      same String variable in the pool.

    • If String is not immutable then it would cause a severe security threat to the application. For example, database username, password are passed as String to get database
      connection and in socket programming host and port details passed as String. Since String is immutable, its value can't be change otherwise any hacker could change the referenced
      value to cause security issues in the application.

    • Since String is immutable, it is safe for multithreading. A single String instance can be shared across different threads. This avoids the use of synchronization for thread safety.

    • Since String is immutable, its hashcode is cached at the time of creation and it doesn't need to be calculated again. This makes it a great candidate for the key in a Map and
     its processing is faster than other HashMap key objects. This is why String is the most widely used as HashMap keys.

 - StringBuffer and StringBuilder classes are mutable this can be used if want to achieve mutability from string.
 - StringBuffer is thread-safe whereas as StringBuilder is not thread-safe.

1. `intern()` method:
   - The `intern()` method is a method of the `String` class in Java. It returns the canonical representation of the string.
   - It searches the pool for the string with the same content. If the string is found, it returns the reference to that string.
     If not found, it adds the string to the pool and returns its reference.
   - Usage example:
     String s1 = new String("hello").intern(); // Returns the reference to the string "hello" in the string pool

2. `join()` method:
   - The `join()` method is a method of the `String` class in Java introduced in Java 8. It concatenates the elements of an array, or any `Iterable` object,
     into a single string with a specified delimiter between each element.
   - Usage example:
     String[] words = {"Java", "is", "awesome"};
     String result = String.join(" ", words); // Returns "Java is awesome"

These are the basic usages of the `intern()` and `join()` methods in Java.

char[] array vs String which on you prefer for storing password? and why?

For storing passwords, it's generally recommended to use char[] array over String. Here's why:

- String will always be present in string constant pool until garbage collector clean up
- This increases the risk of exposing the password to unauthorized access via memory dumps or string interning.
- String values can be directly viewed or printed.
- When accessing a `char[]` array directly, it typically prints the hash code representation of the array object.
