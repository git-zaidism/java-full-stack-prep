# Process for Problem Solving I Use in LeetCode

- Read the problem twice to understand it (ask clarifying questions)
- Try to think of different basic ways to solve the problem
- Think end-to-end (EE) about the best solutions based on complexity
- Write the algorithm from patterns in drawing
- Code it out
- Try and improve it once you think you're finished
- Go through other solutions (even if you answered correctly)
