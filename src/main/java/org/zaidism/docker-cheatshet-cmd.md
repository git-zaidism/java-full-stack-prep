# CLI Cheat Sheet

## Images

### Build an Image from a Dockerfile
```bash
docker build -t <image_name> 
```

### Build an Image from a Dockerfile without the cache
```bash
docker build -t <image_name> . --no-cache 
```

### List local images
```bash
docker images 
```

### Delete an Image
```bash
docker rmi <image_name> 
```

### Remove all unused images
```bash
docker image prune 
```

## Docker Hub

### Login into Docker
```bash
docker login -u <username>
```

### Publish an image to Docker Hub
```bash
docker push <username>/<image_name>
```

### Search Hub for an image
```bash
docker search <image_name>
```

### Pull an image from Docker Hub
```bash
docker pull <image_name>
```

## Containers

### Create and run a container from an image, with a custom name
```bash
docker run --name <container_name> <image_name>
```

### Run a container and publish a containerâ€™s port(s) to the host
```bash
docker run -p <host_port>:<container_port> <image_name>
```

### Run a container in the background
```bash
docker run -d <image_name>
```

### Start or stop an existing container
```bash
docker start|stop <container_name> (or <container-id>)
```

### Remove a stopped container
```bash
docker rm <container_name>
```

### Open a shell inside a running container
```bash
docker exec -it <container_name> sh
```

### Fetch and follow the logs of a container
```bash
docker logs -f <container_name>
```

### Inspect a running container
```bash
docker inspect <container_name> (or <container_id>)
```

### List currently running containers
```bash
docker ps
```

### List all Docker containers (running and stopped)
```bash
docker ps --all
```

### View resource usage stats
```bash
docker container stats
```

## General Commands

### Start the Docker daemon
```bash
docker -d
```

### Get help with Docker
```bash
docker --help
```

### Display system-wide information
```bash
docker info
```

## Overview

Docker provides the ability to package and run an application in a loosely isolated environment called a container. The isolation and security allow you to run many containers simultaneously on a given host. Containers are lightweight and contain everything needed to run the application, so you do not need to rely on what is currently installed on the host. You can easily share containers while you work, and be sure that everyone you share with gets the same container that works in the same way.

### Images
Docker images are a lightweight, standalone, executable package of software that includes everything needed to run an application: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries, and settings.

### Docker Hub
Docker Hub is a service provided by Docker for finding and sharing container images with your team. Learn more and find images at [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com).

### Containers
A container is a runtime instance of a Docker image. A container will always run the same, regardless of the infrastructure. Containers isolate software from its environment and ensure that it works uniformly despite differences between development and staging.
