# Java Backend Interview Roadmap (2026 Edition)

## 6–8 Month Structured Timeline

This timeline assumes ~3–4 hours per day of consistent study and practice.
If you have less time, extend each phase slightly. If you can study full-time, you can compress it.

* JOINs
* Indexing
* Normalization
* Transactions
* ACID
* Isolation Levels

Parallel DSA:

* Linked List
* Stack
* Queue
* Hashing
* Trees (Binary Tree, BST)

Target:

* 60–70 total DSA problems completed

---

# ✅ Month 4: JDBC → JPA → Hibernate

## JDBC

* Connection handling
* Statement vs PreparedStatement
* Transactions

## JPA & Hibernate

* ORM concept
* Entity mapping
* Relationships
* Fetch types
* Cascade types
* N+1 problem
* JPQL & Native queries
* Pagination & Sorting

Mini Project:

* CLI-based CRUD project with database

---

# ✅ Month 5: Spring Boot Core

## Core Spring

* Dependency Injection
* IOC Container
* Bean lifecycle

## Spring Boot Basics

* REST APIs
* Controller → Service → Repository
* DTOs
* Validation
* Global Exception Handling
* application.properties

Build Project #1:

* Auth-based REST API with CRUD

---

# ✅ Month 6: Spring Data JPA + Security + Testing

## Spring Data JPA

* Specification API

## Spring Security

* Authentication & Authorization
* Role-based access
* JWT
* CORS & CSRF

## Testing

* JUnit 5
* Mockito
* @SpringBootTest

Build Project #2:

* Secure REST API with JWT

---

# ✅ Month 7: Advanced Backend + Deployment

## Production Topics

* Logging
* Actuator
* AOP
* Caching (Redis)
* Rate Limiting

## Docker & Deployment

* Dockerfile
* Docker Compose
* Deploy on AWS / Render
* Environment Variables

Build Project #3:

* Dockerized
* Deployed live

---

# ✅ Month 8 (Optional but Powerful): System Design + Microservices

## System Design Basics

* Monolith vs Microservices
* Load Balancing
* Caching strategy
* Database scaling
* Horizontal vs Vertical scaling

## Microservices Basics

* API Gateway
* Config Server
* Service communication
* Circuit Breaker

## Mock Interviews

* Core Java deep questions
* SQL query writing
* Explain internal working
* Discuss project architecture clearly

---

# 📌 Weekly Routine Suggestion

* 3 days: Concept learning
* 2 days: DSA practice
* 1 day: Project building
* 1 day: Revision + mock interview practice

---

# 🎯 Final Goal by End of 6–8 Months

You should be able to:

* Explain internal working of Java concepts
* Write optimized SQL queries
* Build secure REST APIs
* Deploy production-ready Spring Boot apps
* Solve medium-level DSA problems confidently
* Explain trade-offs in system design discussions

Consistency beats intensity.
Focus on depth over rushing through topics.
